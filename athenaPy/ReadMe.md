## AWS Athena access using Python and boto3

The code here is able to execute queries against AWS Athena database tables. Results are returned the results to the console and displayed is a well formatted table using Rich Console output

_Update (2024-06-11 14:40 MDT):_ Was able to apply comma thousands separator formatting to the frequency column in the console table.  Look in main.py at line 38.
